  [code](https://github.com/nvlabs/spade/)

## Image Style Transfer
* [Artbreeder based on BigGAN models](https://artbreeder.com/)
   [opensource version](https://github.com/joel-simon/ganbreeder)
   [BigGAN models](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-512/2)
   [About](https://artbreeder.com/about)
* A cool project: [Visual Novel using ML Style transfer](https://medium.com/@pbriod/how-i-used-artificial-intelligence-to-make-my-first-graphic-novel-about-my-trip-to-india-although-ff4af46fd6a3)
## Text-to-Image:
* dataset: [Google’s “Quick Draw” open source dataset](https://opensource.google/projects/quickdrawdataset)
  [github](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset)

## Image Captioning
* [Tensorflow core: Image captioning with visual attention](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning)

## Text-to-Animation
* [Generating Animations from Screenplays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05440.pdf)

## Text Generation/NLP
* [OpenAI 1.5 billion params GPT-2 release](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/)
* [AIDungeon](https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon)
* [ctrl-gce: CTRL text-generating model on Google Compute Engine with just a few console commands.](https://github.com/minimaxir/ctrl-gce), why google compute engine: The CTRL model is so large (12 GB on disk, 15.5 GB GPU VRAM when loaded, even more system RAM during runtime) that it will currently not fit into a free Colaboratory or Kaggle Notebook. 
* [Writing with the machine](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/writing-with-the-machine/)
  [scifi corpus txt dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jannesklaas/scifi-stories-text-corpus)
  Could be useful for gpt2 model fine tune
* [GPT2-Chinese-wuxiao-novel](https://leemeng.tw/gpt2-language-model-generate-chinese-jing-yong-novels.html)
* [GPT-2 Chinese](https://github.com/Morizeyao/GPT2-Chinese)
* [Hugging face Transformer]-Pytorch hub 

### Text Corpus/dataset
* [Sci-fi-Script](http://www.scifiscripts.com/)
* [Detroit-Becoming-Human](https://github.com/detroitbecometext/detroitbecometext.github.io)
   Could be source to analyze dialogue tree and decision tree structure.
   

## Audio and music generation/processing
### Project:
* [Talking like your favorite character: Text-To-Speech audio generation ](https://fifteen.ai/app)
